# tic-tac-toe
App I made for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe).



## Things I learned 
- Basic of html,css and javascript
- basic working of websocket
- implementing neuralnet from scratch
- gradient descent algorithm for neuralnet
- forward and backward propagation of neuralnet


## Remaining Work
- Add Regularization for neuralnet for better performance(prevent overfitting)
- Improve the training data and optimized the neuralnet for better performance (tuning hyperparamters)

## Features:
- Websocket implemented more than two players can play tic tac toe over the network.
- Neuralnet is integrated with websocket on python
- User can play with neuralnet and they can also optimize its performance by fine tuning the hyperparameter
